This is a bot to use in your Tinychat room,<br/>
It's an aid to help moderate a room from spam and bad users, It's also a tool for YouTube/Soundcloud,<br/>
You're able to add multiple songs to a playlist, This also has other features ranging from weather to yomama jokes,<br/>
This is using the pinylib library by @nortxort, You'll need all the dependencies for this to work,<br/>
You can install the modules directly in your python library or run them from the bot folder,<br/>
Just make sure you have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Please check the [commands](https://github.com/Tinychat/Tinychat-Bot/wiki) for the full list.

This has fixes from the old bot and improvements,<br/>
Moderators cannot ban another Moderator (I wasn't aware of this until a user (`Jesus`) informed me.)<br/>
Moderators now have better controls over the room for when the super user is not available,<br/>
Some of which are `op`, `deop`, `guests`, `guestnicks`, `badnicks`,`badaccounts` without the need for a key.
